## Description
This Shiny app, Statistical Data Analysis Dashboard, provides users with tools to interactively analyze their datasets. It includes the following features:

#### 1. Upload Data: 
    - Upload a CSV file and preview the first 10 rows of your dataset.

#### 2. Data Summary:
    - Select a variable from the uploaded dataset to view key summary statistics, including the minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
    - If the selected variable is non-numeric, the app will inform you.

#### 3. Visualizations:
    - Generate a histogram for a chosen variable to explore its distribution.
    - Create scatter plots between two variables with a computed correlation coefficient, including a linear trend line for better interpretation.


This app simplifies data exploration by providing user-friendly visualizations and statistics for uploaded datasets.

## Dataset Source
This app requires users to upload their own dataset in **CSV** format. Users can interact with any dataset structured in tabular form with appropriate column headers.

To demonstrate its functionality, the app has been tested using the following dataset:
